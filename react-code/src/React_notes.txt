What is JSX?

2 ways to create new components:
--------------------------------
Class component
----------------
default export is used to export only one object
when using default export you can import it in any name
e.g export default TodoComponent;
import newComp from ./component/TodoComponent

If you want to export multiple components, you should do named export.
e.g: export {TodoComponent};
import {TodoComponent} from './component/TodoComponent';

Named export should be imported with same name.

Alias:
------

Functional component
--------------------
Just a function returning elements.
No render function is needed
stateless component??
hooks??

Props
-----
Props are properties used to pass data between react components.
data flow is unidirectional, from parent to child only. Data cannot flow from child to parent.

ReactDom.render(<APP name="Nathan"/>, document.get)

State:
------
Components use state to manage their own data. It is internal to compponent and cannot be passed to other component.
